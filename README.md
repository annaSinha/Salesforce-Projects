LightningSteps is a global shoe brand company, they would like to have a single-page order placement app built with Lightning components in their Salesforce environment. 

The app should contain at least these 3 main functional components: 

● A Component to list products and to show prices and a picture of the product, with an "add to cart" button. 

● A Component to filter the products based on chosen attributes (e.g. category: boot, running shoe, etc.; price). 

● Shopping cart component to show a summary of products and a button "make an order" which will create an order record with the selected products.
